Overview
This script is designed to automate various security hardening steps for Ubuntu 24.04 systems, incorporating recommendations from the Lynis security audit tool. It ensures that the system is set up according to best practices and enhances its security posture by performing the following actions:

Features
System Updates: Updates the package list to ensure the system has access to the latest packages and security patches.

Lynis Security Audit: Installs Lynis if not already present and runs a security audit to gather system hardening recommendations.

Installation of Recommended Packages:

Installs key packages such as libpam-tmpdir, apt-listchanges, needrestart, rkhunter, bsd-mailx, apt-show-versions, and debsums for enhanced system monitoring and hardening.

Fail2ban Configuration:
Installs and configures Fail2ban, automatically checking if IPv6 is in use and adjusting its configuration accordingly.

System Monitoring (sysstat):
Installs and enables sysstat for system performance and activity monitoring.

Auditd Setup:
Installs and configures auditd to monitor critical file changes, including basic audit rules for monitoring /etc/passwd, /etc/group, and /etc/shadow.

RKHunter Installation:
Installs RKHunter for rootkit detection, configures it, and updates its database.

Legal Banners Configuration:
Sets up legal warning banners in /etc/issue and /etc/issue.net.

Password Policy Configuration:
Configures password aging and complexity policies in /etc/login.defs to enforce stronger password practices.

Core Dump Disabling:
Disables core dumps in /etc/security/limits.conf to prevent unauthorized data access.

Protocol Disabling:
Disables unused and potentially insecure protocols (e.g., dccp, sctp, rds, and tipc) in /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist.conf.

CUPS Configuration:
Secures the CUPS configuration file if CUPS is installed on the system.

Process Accounting:
Installs and enables process accounting using acct to log process activity for monitoring purposes.

File Integrity Monitoring:
Installs and initializes AIDE, a file integrity monitoring tool, to keep track of changes to critical files.

Sysctl Hardening:
Applies sysctl settings to enhance network security and hardening based on recommended best practices.

Compiler Access Restriction:
Restricts access to system compilers (gcc, cc) to the root user only.

Service Restart Management:
Uses needrestart to check which services need restarting after updates to ensure system stability and security.
Manual Interventions
The script provides prompts for the following manual steps:

Adding separate partitions for /home, /tmp, and /var for improved filesystem isolation and security.
Reviewing and updating sysctl values as recommended by Lynis.
Further customizing audit rules in auditd for more granular monitoring.
